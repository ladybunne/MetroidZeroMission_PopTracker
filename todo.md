## To Do

OOL accessible:
- [ ] Norfair Behind Lower Super Missile Door with jump extends
- [ ] Norfair Bomb Trap with basically anything
- [ ] Any other crimes I can think of
- [ ] Maybe account for remote items on for hellruns?

Scoutables:
- [x] Brinstar Main Shaft Left Alcove

Bosses: 
- [x] Boss logic locations (Kraid, Ridley, Mother Brain, Chozo Ghost)
- [x] Link behind-boss item accessibility to the logic of the boss they're behind (Kraid, Ridley)

Tracker options:
- [ ] Enable/disable scoutables
- [ ] Enable/disable certain categories of OOL accessibility

## Maybe

- Ask for an event for when you've escaped? Would make some logic in PopTracker more "responsive".

## Done

- [x] Make unknown items show up as their unknown variants if playing on Unknown Items Always Usable false and haven't beaten ghost
